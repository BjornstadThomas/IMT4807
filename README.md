# IMT4807
IMT4807 - Integration Project

The project aims to develop a user-friendly tool for generating synthetic 
images that allows users to browse through a folder and choose an appropriate image 
generation model to generate new images. The focus will be on simplicity and ease of use, 
rather than incorporating advanced features.
